# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¬ Uganda Dashboard

The Uganda Dashboard is based on the SCORE (Sustainable Capacity of Local Organizations to Reach and End the HIV/AIDS Pandemic) survey. It consists of three distinct sub-tabs, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Comparison Tab**: Compare institutional performance across different sections.
2. **Filtering Tab**: Filter scores from 1 to 5 to identify questions with lower scores.
3. **Institution-Specific Tab**: Select a specific institution to compare its performance across various sections.

Feel free to explore it!
